\begin{parts}
\part In the worst case, how long does it take to index into a linked list?
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
$\Theta(N)$
\end{solution}

\part In the worst case, how long does it take to index into an array?
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
$\Theta(1)$
\end{solution}

\part In the worst case, how long does it take to insert into a linked list?
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
$\Theta(N)$, where $N$ is the length of the linked list.
\end{solution}

\part Assuming there's space, how long does it take to put a element in an array?
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
$\Theta(1)$
\end{solution}

\part What if we assume there is no more space in the array?
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
$\Theta(N)$ to copy over $N$ elements into the new array.
\end{solution}

\part Given what we know about linked lists and arrays, when would we choose to use one data structure over the other?
\begin{solution}[1.25in]
If you know in advance how large your data structure is, arrays are faster than linked lists in insertion, mutation, etc.
However, if the array needs to expand frequently then things get expensive.
But there are ways to amortize the cost of resizing with \texttt{ArrayLists}, for example.
\begin{itemize}
\item Objects with rows and columns (like a chessboard) where we wish to randomly index into exact position and where the board is of a fixed size
\item Arguments to a java program: \texttt{String[] args}. Using a resizing \texttt{List} in this scenario doesn't necessarily make things better since the arguments to a program don't change once we start the program.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}
