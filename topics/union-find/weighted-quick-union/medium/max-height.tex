\question Describe how to construct a \texttt{WeightedQuickUnionUF} tree of maximum height.

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
To construct a max-height tree of $N$ nodes, union two max-height trees with $\frac{N}{2}$ nodes each. The height of the final tree is 1 greater than each of the max-height $\frac{N}{2}$-node trees.
