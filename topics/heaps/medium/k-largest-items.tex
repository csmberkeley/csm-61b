\question The largest item in a heap must appear in position 1, and the second largest must appear in position 2 or 3. Give the list of positions in a heap where the $k$th largest can appear for $k \in \{2, 3, 4\}$. Assume values are distinct.

\begin{solution}[1in]
$k = 2$ can be in $\{2, 3\}$. $k = 3$ can be in $\{2 \ldots 7\}$. $k = 4$ can be in $\{2 \ldots 15\}$.

Consider complete binary trees with the largest values contained on one branch of the tree for a lower bound and consider how far the $k$th element can be from the root for an upper bound.
\end{solution}
