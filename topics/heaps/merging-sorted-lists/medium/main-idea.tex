\question Given the following sorted lists as inputs, how we can efficiently
return a sorted list containing all the elements?

\begin{lstlisting}
inputs: {1, 2, 3, 7}, {3, 4, 5, 6}, {2, 4, 6, 8}, {0, 1, 2, 4}, {1, 1, 6, 9}
output: {0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Use a priority queue of iterators where the priority is given by
\lstinline$peek()$, or the value that would be returned from calling
\lstinline$next()$.
\end{solution}
