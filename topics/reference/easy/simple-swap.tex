\question What is wrong with this definition of \texttt{swap}? How can we fix it?

\begin{lstlisting}
class SimpleSwap {
    public static void swap(int a, int b) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a;
        a = temp;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 2;
        int y = 5;
        System.out.println("x: " + x + ", y: " + y);
        swap(x, y);
        System.out.println("x: " + x + ", y: " + y);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.25in]
\begin{verbatim}
x: 2, y: 5
x: 2, y: 5
\end{verbatim}
In the main method, \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} won't actually be swapped.
Within \texttt{swap}, we can change what \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} point to, but we can't change the variables that were declared in \texttt{main}. We can fix this by either in-lining the \texttt{swap} functionality in the \texttt{main} method or returning and reassigning the swapped values using an object.
\end{solution}
