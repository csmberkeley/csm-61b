\question How is this implementation of \texttt{swap} different?

\begin{lstlisting}
class SwapObject {
    public static void swap(Point p) {
        int temp = p.x;
        p.x = p.y;
        p.y = temp;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point p = new Point(2, 5);
        System.out.println("p.x: " + p.x + ", p.y: " + p.y);
        swap(p);
        System.out.println("p.x: " + p.x + ", p.y: " + p.y);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
When calling \texttt{swap} with a \texttt{Point} object, we're passing a reference to the original \texttt{Point} object. The object's instance variables can be changed from within \texttt{swap} and will remain changed after we exit from the function.
\end{solution}
