A \lstinline$State$ of this puzzle is some permutation of the puzzle tiles.
There are two things we can do with a \lstinline$State$:

\begin{itemize}
\item Get the set of next possible states from the current \lstinline$State$.
\item Find out if the \lstinline$State$ is a goal: in this case when the
puzzle is solved.
\end{itemize}

Imagine a game graph as a graph of all possible states where each state is a
graph node and where a method, \lstinline$getNextStates$, returns the neighbor
nodes. Finding a solution is equivalent to finding a path from some start
state to goal state.
