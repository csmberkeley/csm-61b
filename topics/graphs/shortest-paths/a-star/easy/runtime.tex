%VERY SIMILAR TO DIJKSTRA'S RUNTIME QUESTION -- DONT USE BOTH

\question Suppose that our understanding of data structures has advanced such that we can now remove from a priority queue in constant time! How does this change A-star’s asymptotic run time?

\begin{solution}

This doesn’t change the run time of A-star’s, because we still have to update every edge in the priority queue. Because the cost of this update operation doesn’t change (it’s still $log(V)$), updating every edge will still take $Elog(V)$ time. 

Instead of running in O(V log (V) + E log (V)), we now run in O(log(v) + E log (V)) which reduces to the "same" O(E log (V)).

\end{solution}
