\question What is a \emph{heuristic}? What is its correctness conditions?

\begin{solution}[1in]
A \emph{heuristic} is a best-guess estimate. In the case of A* search, we use
the heuristic to estimate the distance left to travel to the goal. For the
purposes of our class, a heuristic is correct if it is \emph{admissible}, or
never overestimates the distance to the goal.
