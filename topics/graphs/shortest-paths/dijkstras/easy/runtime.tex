\question Assuming the runtime for \lstinline$changePriority$ is in $O(f(N))$
and \lstinline$removeMin$ is in $O(g(N))$ where $N$ is the size of the priority
queue, give the runtime of Dijkstra's algorithm on the simple graph
$G = (V, E)$.

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$O(|E| \cdot f(|V|) + |V| \cdot g(|V|))$
\end{solution}
