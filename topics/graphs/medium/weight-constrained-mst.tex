\question Briefly describe an efficient algorithm (and report the running time) for finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected, connected graph $G = (V, E)$ when the edge weights satisfy:

\begin{parts}
\part For all $e \in E$, $w_e = 1$.
\begin{solution}[1.5in]
The key idea here is that any tree which connects all nodes is an MST. We can run DFS and take the DFS tree. You could also take a BFS tree, or run Prim's algorithm with a queue or stack instead of a priority queue (this would be equivalent to BFS/DFS). The runtime of this algorithm is in $\Theta(|V| + |E|) \in \Theta(|E|)$ for simple graphs.
\end{solution}

\part For all $e \in E$, $w_e \in \{1, 2\}$. (In other words, all edge weights are either 1 or 2.)
\begin{solution}[1.5in]
Run Prim's algorithm with a specialized priority queue, comprised of 2 regular queues. When we add items to the priority queue, we add it to the first queue if the weight is 1 and otherwise add it to the second queue (the weight must be 2). When we pop from the priority queue, we take from the first queue, unless it is empty, in which case we take from the second. The runtime of this algorithm is in $\Theta(|E|)$ as priority queue operations are now constant time.
\end{solution}
