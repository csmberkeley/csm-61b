\question For the graph below, write the order in which vertices are visited
using the specified algorithm starting from $A$. Break ties by alphabetical
order.

\part DFS
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$A - C - D - B - E - F - G - H$ \\
Use a Stack when traversing through this graph, similar to tree traversal.
% A Stack has a LIFO (Last in First Out) nature that is used to perform the traversal. \\
% To be more specific, you add node A to the fringe. Pop it, add its children, G and then C to the fringe. (Every time a node is popped and is not in the seen set, add it to the set). Since it is LIFO, you would pop C out first and add all its children, H and then D to the fringe. Then you would pop D, and add its child F and then B, to the fringe. Then you would pop B, and its child, E to the fringe. Pop E, but since it has no children, you would not add anything to the fringe. Once you've popped E, you would pop F, and add its children - G to the fringe. Then you would pop G, but because it has no children, nothing is added to the Stack. Lastly, pop 5!

\part BFS

$A - C - G - D - H - F - B - E$ \\
Use a Queue when traversing through the graph, similar to tree traversal.
