\question Is this algorithm for computing the shortest path between two
vertices correct?

Given a starting vertex, $s$, and an ending vertex, $v$, compute the shortest
path between $s$ and $v$ by running DFS, but at each node exploring the
shortest outgoing edge first until $v$ is reached. Return the $s$ to $v$ path
in the DFS tree.

\begin{solution}[2in]
Incorrect. Consider the graph below whose true shortest path is $s - v$ but
whose greedy DFS path is $s - t - v$.
