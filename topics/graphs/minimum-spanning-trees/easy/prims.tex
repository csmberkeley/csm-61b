\question Describe Prim's algorithm.

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Starting from any arbitrary source, repeatedly add the shortest edge that
connects some node in the tree to some node outside the tree.

Another way of thinking about Prim's algorithm is that it is basically just
Dtra's algorithm, but where we consider node in order of the distance from the
\emph{entire tree}, rather than the distance from the start.
\end{solution}
