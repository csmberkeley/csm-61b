\question Suppose we want to design a telephone network connecting all the
cities, labeled $A$ to $G$, in a neighborhood. We'd like to do so at the least
cost.

\begin{parts}
\part In a graph with $N$ vertices and $M$ edges, how many edges form a minimum
spanning tree?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$N - 1$, or 6 edges in the above graph.
\end{solution}

\part Will the new graph contain any cycles? Describe its structure.
\begin{solution}[1in]
The resulting graph is a tree which implies that it contains no cycles. If the
tree reaches every node in the graph, then it is a \define{spanning tree}.
A graph may have many spanning trees, but we are particularly interested in
\define{minimum spanning trees}, or spanning trees that minimize the total
weight of the tree.
\end{solution}

\part One algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree is Kruskal's algorithm.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort all the edges by increasing order of their weight.
\item Pick the smallest edge and check if it forms a cycle with the spanning
tree so far. If it doesn't form a cycle, add this edge to the spanning tree.
\item Repeat the previous step until there are $|V| - 1$ edges in the spanning
tree, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the graph.
\end{enumerate}

Run Kruskal's Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree.

\draw (50,-25.5) -- (50,-34.5);
\draw (49.5,-30) node [left] {$1$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\textbf{Meta}: Draw only the nodes and add the edges that are part of the MST
as you walk through the problem. Labeling all the edges would take a long time,
and erasing is confusing and complicated.
