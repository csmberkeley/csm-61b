Intro: The cut property is introduced in the general statement for this question. Make sure to have a simple example to use as a visual when explaining it to students.\newline\newline 
1.3: Your board work for how to run through Prim's should be very similar to how you ran through Djikstra's algorithm in the previous worksheet. Only add edges to your MST as you pop off the Fringe (PQ). Additionarlly, after running through the problem, explain how at a high level, for every edge added, we just added the shortest edge not in the MST into the MST. Use the cut property to explain this.
