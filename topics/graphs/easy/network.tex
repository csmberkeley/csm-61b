\question Suppose we need to design a telephone network connecting all the residents, labeled $A$ through $G$, in a neighborhood. How can we create a network that guarantees connectivity between all subscribers at the least possible cost?

\begin{parts}
\part In a graph with $N$ vertices and $M$ edges, how many edges form a minimum spanning tree?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$N-1$, or 6 edges in the above graph.
\end{solution}

\part Will the new graph contain any cycles? Describe the structure of the graph.
\begin{solution}[1in]
The resulting graph is a tree which implies that it contains no cycles. If the tree reaches every node in the graph, then it is a \define{spanning tree}. A graph may have many spanning trees, but we are particularly interested in \define{minimum spanning trees}, or spanning trees that minimize the total weight of the tree.
\end{solution}

\part Run Kruskal's Algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.
