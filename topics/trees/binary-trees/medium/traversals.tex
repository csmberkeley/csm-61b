What would Java display?

\begin{parts}
\part \lstinline$tree.traversal(new Queue<Node>());$
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
\begin{verbatim}
1275934
\end{verbatim}

A Queue has a FIFO (First in First Out) nature that is used to perform the traversal. \\
To be more specific, you add node 1 to the queue. You then pop it and print its value, and add its children, 2 and then 7 to the queue. Since it is FIFO, you would pop 2 out first and add all its children, 5 and then 9 to the queue. Then you would pop 7, and add its child 3 to the queue. Then you would pop 5 and 9, who have no children to add. Next, you pop 3, add 4 to queue. Lastly you pop 4 and you are done!  

 Make sure you explain the FIFO nature of the Queue and visually represent how the solution 1275934 is arrived at using a Queue.
\end{solution}

\part \lstinline$tree.traversal(new Stack<Node>());$
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
\begin{verbatim}
1734295
\end{verbatim}

A Stack has a LIFO (Last in First Out) nature that is used to perform the traversal. \\
To be more specific, you add node 1 to the queue. Pop it, add its children, 2 and then 7 to the queue. (Every time you pop a node it gets printed). Since it is LIFO, you would pop 7 out first and add all its children, 3 to the queue. Then you would pop 3, and add its child 4, to the queue. Then you would pop 4, but since it has no children, you would not add anything to the Stack. Once you've popped 4, you would pop 2, and add its children to the Stack - 5 and then 9. Then you would pop 9, but because it has no children, nothing is added to the Stack. Lastly, pop 5!
\end{solution}
