\question Define a procedure, \texttt{height}, which takes in a \texttt{Node} and outputs the height of the tree. Recall that the height of a leaf node is 0.

\begin{lstlisting}

Meta: That this Binary Tree class is an encapsulated binary tree.  
This means that in a recursive function, we want to recurse on that 
particular node.

private int height(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return -1;
    }
    return 1 + Math.max(height(node.left), height(node.right));
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

What is the runtime of \texttt{height}?
\begin{solution}[0.25in]
$\Theta(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the tree.  You touch every node once, and at each node, you do a constant amount of work (null check).  The actual "work" is done in the recursion, where we repeatedly step down through every node on the tree.
