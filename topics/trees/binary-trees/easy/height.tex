\question Define a procedure, \lstinline$height$, which takes in a
\lstinline$Node$ and outputs the height of the tree. Recall that the height of
a leaf node is 0.

\begin{lstlisting}
private int height(Node node) {








}
\end{lstlisting}
\fi

\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
private int height(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return -1;
    }
    return 1 + Math.max(height(node.left), height(node.right));
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Meta}: That this Binary Tree class is an encapsulated binary tree. This
means that in a recursive function, we want to recurse on that particular node.
\end{solution}

What is the runtime of \lstinline$height$?
\begin{solution}[0.25in]
$\Theta(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit every node
once and at each node perform a constant amount of work (\lstinline$null$
check). The actual ``work'' that contributes to the order of growth is done in
the recursion, where we repeatedly step down through every node in the tree.
