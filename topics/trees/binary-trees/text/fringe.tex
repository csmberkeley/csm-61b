A \textbf{queue} is a data structure that orders items in a first-in-first-out
(FIFO) manner, meaning that the first element you \lstinline$add$ will be at
the front and the last item you \lstinline$add$ will be at the tail. Elements
are \lstinline$remove$d from the front.

A \textbf{stack} is a data structure that orders items in a last-in-first-out
(LIFO) manner, meaning that the first element you \lstinline$add$ will be at
the tail and the last item you \lstinline$add$ will be at the front. Elements
are \lstinline$remove$d from the front.
