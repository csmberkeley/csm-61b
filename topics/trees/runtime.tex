\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{Xll}
Operations                         & Binary Search      & Balanced Search         \\\hline
\lstinline$boolean contains(E e);$ & $\Omega(1)\; O(N)$ & $\Omega(1)\; O(\log N)$ \\
\lstinline$boolean add(E e);$      & $\Omega(1)\; O(N)$ & $\Theta(\log N)$
\end{tabularx}
}

For \lstinline$boolean contains(E e)$, the best case is always $\Theta(1)$ for
both binary search trees and balanced search trees. This is the case if the
node we are looking for is at the root of the tree. The worst case for binary
search trees is if the tree is completely unbalanced (a spindly tree), and the
node we are looking for is a leaf, yielding a time complexity of $\Theta(N)$
because we have to visit every node.

However, for a balanced search tree, we know that the height of the tree will
never exceed $\Theta(\log N)$. Thus, even if the node we are looking for is a
leaf, we will never have to search more than $\Theta(\log N)$ nodes.

For \lstinline$boolean add(E e)$, we always have to insert nodes as a a leaf.
For a binary search tree, imagine a right-leaning spindly tree (where all of
the root's children are in its right subtree). To insert a node in the root's
left subtree, this would simply be a constant time operation because there are
no nodes in the left subtree, so we would just need to set the root's left
child to the node we are inserting. This is the best case for binary search
trees, so the runtime is $\Theta(1)$ in this case. However, to insert a node in
the root's right subtree, we would have to move all the way down the spindly
tree, passing every node, to reach the leaf node to insert the new node.
This is the worst case for binary search trees, so the runtime is $\Theta(N)$.

For balanced binary search trees, the height will always be $\Theta(\log N)$
nodes. This means that every insertion will always have to visit
$\Theta(\log N)$ nodes to reach a leaf. Thus, the runtime is always in
$\Theta(\log N)$.
