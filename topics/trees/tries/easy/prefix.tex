\question Given a list of words (possibly repeated), devise a strategy to
efficiently return a list of all the words that start with a given prefix.

\begin{solution}[1.5in]
Put all the names into a trie, lookup the prefix in the trie, and iterate
across all the children rooted at that node.
\end{solution}
