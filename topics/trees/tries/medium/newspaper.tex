\question Given a dictionary of words, describe a procedure for checking if a
new word can be created out of the concatenation of two words in the
dictionary. For example, if our dictionary contains the words,
\lstinline$"news"$, \lstinline$"paper"$, \lstinline$"new"$, and
\lstinline$"ape"$, we should be able to discover the new word,
\lstinline$"newspaper"$.

\begin{solution}[1in]
We can put all of the words in the dictionary into a trie. Then we can check a
prefix of the word and see if the remainder of the word is in the trie as
well.
\end{solution}
