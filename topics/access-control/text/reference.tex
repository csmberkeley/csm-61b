\define{Access control} allows us to restrict the use of fields, methods, and classes.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{public}: Accessible by everyone.
\item \texttt{protected}: Accessible by the class itself, the package, and any subclasses.
\item \textit{default (no modifier)}: Accessible by the class itself and the package.
\item \texttt{private}: Accessible only by the class itself.
\end{itemize}
