\begin{lstlisting}
Pikachu p = new Pikachu();
Pokemon a = p;
// p = a; (1)
a.eat();
a = new Squirtle();
// a.attack(); (2)
((Squirtle) a).attack();
Pokemon z = new Pikachu();
// Squirtle s = (Squirtle) z; (3)
((Pokemon) p).attack(z);
\end{lstlisting}
(1) is a compiler-time error since you can't assign a static type Pokemon to
a variable who has a static type Pikachu. Can be solved with a cast.
\\
(2) is a compiler-time error because Pokemon does not have a method with the signature attack().
\\
(3) is a run-time error because the dynamic type of z (Pikachu) cannot be cast
to a Squirtle.
\end{solution}
