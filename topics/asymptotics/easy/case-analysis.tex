\question Give a tight asymptotic runtime bound for \lstinline$containsZero$ as
a function of $N$, the size of the input array in the \emph{best case, worst
case, and overall}.

\begin{lstlisting}
public static boolean containsZero(int[] array) {
    for (int value : array) {
        if (value == 0) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
$\Theta(1)$ in the best case, $\Theta(N)$ in the worst case, and $\Omega(1),
O(N)$ overall.

Asymptotic analysis is always concerned with what happens as our input grows to
infinity. In this case, we'd like to describe the order of growth of
\lstinline$containsZero$ as a function of the \emph{size} of the input array,
but that doesn't say anything about the contents of the input array.

We could find a zero at the beginning of the array: this is the best case as
we can terminate in $\Theta(1)$. Or there could be no zeroes in the array at
all: this is the worst case, which terminates $\Theta(N)$. We can then describe
the overall runtime of the function taking into account all possible cases from
spanning from best to worst: hence, the overall runtime is $\Omega(1), O(N)$.
