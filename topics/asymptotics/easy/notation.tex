\question Define, in your own words, each of the following asymptotic notation.

\begin{parts}
\part $O$

\begin{solution}[0.25in]
`Big-O' notation gives an \emph{upper} bound on the runtime of a function as
the size of the input approaches infinity.
\end{solution}

\part $\Omega$

\begin{solution}[0.25in]
`Big-Omega' notation gives a \emph{lower} bound on the runtime of a function as
the size of the input approaches infinity.
\end{solution}

\part $\Theta$

\begin{solution}[0.25in]
`Big-Theta' notation gives a \emph{tight} bound on the runtime of a function as
the size of the input approaches infinity.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}
