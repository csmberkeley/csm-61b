\question Give a tight asymptotic bound for \lstinline$debugBinarySearch$ as a
function of $N$, the length of the input array, \lstinline$a$. If possible,
give a $\Theta(\cdot)$ bound for the overall runtime. Otherwise, provide a
$\Theta(\cdot)$ bound for both the best case and worst case runtime.

\begin{lstlisting}
boolean debugBinarySearch(int[] a, int target) {
    int start = 0;
    int end = a.length - 1;

    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = ((end - start) / 2) + start;
        if (a[mid] == target) {
            return true;
        } else if (a[mid] < target) {
            start = mid + 1;
        } else {
            end = mid - 1;
        }

        System.out.print("Searching: [ ");
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            System.out.print(a[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println("]");
    }
    return false;
}

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$\Theta(N)$ in the worst case, $\Theta(1)$ in the best case.

Normally binary search runs in $\Theta(log(N))$ in the worst case. However, for this function, it also prints out the values of the list it is considering for each iteration of the while loop. In the worst case, you would perform $log(N)$ iterations of your while loop, and your for loop would run $\frac{N}{2} + \frac{N}{4} + ... + 4 + 2 + 1$ times, which would be $\Theta(N)$ runtime. However, in the best case, you could find your target immediately and return in constant time.
