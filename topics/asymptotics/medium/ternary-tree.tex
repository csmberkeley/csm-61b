\question Give a tight asymptotic bound for \lstinline$mystery$.

\begin{lstlisting}
int mystery(int N) {
    if (N == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return mystery(N/3) + mystery(N/3) + mystery(N/3);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
$\Theta(N)$

This is a recursive function with a branching factor of 3. If you draw a tree with all the recursive calls, there will be log(N) levels before the function terminates. There is 1 function call at the top level, 3 recursive calls at the next level, 9 recursive calls at the third level, and each subsequent level triples the number of recursive calls. Since each recursive call does constant work, the total runtime is $3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{log(N)} = 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + N = \Theta(N)$
