\question Give a tight runtime bound for \texttt{mystery} as a function of $N$, the length of the input array.

\begin{lstlisting}
public static int[] mystery(int[] array) {
    boolean done = false;
    while (!done) {
        done = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
            if (array[i-1] > array[i]) {
                done = false;
                int tmp = array[i-1];
                array[i-1] = array[i]
                array[i] = tmp;
            }
        }
    }
    return array;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
This sorting algorithm, known as bubble sort, makes repeated passes through the array, swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order. The algorithm terminates if it completes a pass without swapping any elements. 

Each pass must look through all elements of the array, and in the worse case, if the initial array is in reverse sorted order, makes N passes through the array. The runtime for this function is $O(N^2)$.
