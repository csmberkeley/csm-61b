\begin{blocksection}
\part Compare and contrast interfaces and abstract classes.
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{itemize}
\item Java classes cannot extend multiple superclasses (unlike Python) but classes can implement multiple interfaces.
\item Interfaces are implicitly public.
\item Interfaces can't have fields declared as instance variables; any fields that are declared are implicitly \texttt{static} and \texttt{final}.
\item Interfaces uses the \texttt{default} keyword to declare concrete implementations while abstract classes use the \texttt{abstract} keyword to declare abstract implementations.
\item Interfaces define the way we interact with an implementing object or functions of an object. Conversely, abstract classes define an "is-a" relationship and tell us more about the object's fundamental existence.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Meta:} Warn students to be careful with Google on this topic, the class (and above list) talk about Java 8.
Most content on google right now is Java 7, which behaves differently.

\begin{blocksection}
\part Do we need the \texttt{play} method in \texttt{Snack}?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
No, we do not need the \texttt{play} method because it's already defined in the abstract class. Java will lookup the parent class's method if it cannot find it in the child class.
\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}

\begin{blocksection}
\part \texttt{Consumable chips = new Snack();} \\
Does this compile?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Yes, the code compiles since \texttt{Snack} inherits from the \texttt{Food} class which implements the \texttt{Consumable} interface.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{Meta:} Use this question as a mini-lecture for interfaces to build up to the next question.
This question should not take a lot of time.
