\question Do you expect selection or insertion sort to run more quickly on a
reverse list?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Asymptotically, both algorithms operate run in $\Theta(N^2)$ in this scenario
where $N$ is the length of the reversed list.

Selection sort might be better since it performs only $\Theta(N)$ swaps as
opposed to $\Theta(N^2)$ swaps in insertion sort's case.
\end{solution}
