\question Give a best and worst case input for insertion sort.

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Best case is a completely sorted array with 0 inversions while the worst case
is a reverse-sorted array with $\Theta(N^2)$ inversions. Recall that the
runtime for insertion sort is given by $\Theta(N + K)$ where $K$ is the number
of inversions.
\end{solution}

\question Do you expect selection or insertion sort to run more quickly on a
reverse list?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Asymptotically, both algorithms operate run in $\Theta(N^2)$ in this scenario
where $N$ is the length of the reversed list.

Selection sort might be better since it performs only $\Theta(N)$ swaps as
opposed to $\Theta(N^2)$ swaps in insertion sort's case.
\end{solution}
