\question Why does Java's built-in \lstinline$Array.sort$ method use quicksort
for \lstinline$int$, \lstinline$long$, \lstinline$char$, or other primitive
arrays, but merge sort for all \lstinline$Object$ arrays?

\begin{solution}[1in]
Fast, in-place solutions for quicksort are unstable, meaning that, for any two
equivalent keys, their final order in the output is not guaranteed to be the
same. Merge sort has good asymtotic behavior without sacrificing on stability.
\end{solution}
