\question What's the best sorting algorithm to apply on an array of $N$
randomly distributed Java \lstinline$Object$s? Give a tight asymptotic runtime
bound as well.

\begin{solution}[1in]
Merge sort is the best option since its design makes the algorithm stable,
preserving the relative order of equal items in the list. Quicksort and
heapsort are also acceptable, but because their fast or usual implementations
are unstable, we prefer not to use them on Java reference types.
\end{solution}
