\begin{parts}
\part What are the advantages and disadvantages of quicksort?
\begin{solution}[2in]
Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Faster on average by a constant factor than merge sort
\item In-place variant for $\Theta(1)$ memory complexity. Including the average-case call stack brings up space complexity to $\Theta(\log N)$
\item Multi-pivot quicksort offers greater constant factor optimizations
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Most efficient implementations (in-place) are not stable
\item Worst-case runtime is in $\Theta(N^2)$, thus making it a poor choice for adversarial datasets
\item Not very good for external sorting
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

\part What are the advantages and disadvantages of merge sort?
\begin{solution}[2in]
Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stable
\item Good for external sorting
\item Constant space usage for sorting linked lists
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Slower than quicksort on average
\item Higher space complexity for array allocation
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}
