\question Suppose know that the objects in our list can only be in $O(N^2)$
possible permutations. Give a tight asymptotic lower bound on the running time
of sorting this list.

\begin{solution}[1in]
$\Omega(N)$. The runtime is determined by the number of decisions that need to
be made to identify a particular permutation as correct. If we model the
problem as a decision tree, we can see that we need to make at least
$\Omega(\log{N^2}) \in \Omega(\log N)$ comparisons before identifying a
permutation as correct. But a sorting algorithm cannot be faster than linear
time, so we bound our final answer with $\Omega(N)$.
\end{solution}
