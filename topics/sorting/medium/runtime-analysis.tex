\question We have a list of $N$ elements that should be sorted, but to our surprise we recently discovered that there are at most $k$ pairs out of order, or $k$ \textbf{inversions}, in the list. As a small example, the list \texttt{\{ 0, 1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3 \}} contains 5 inversions: $(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)$.

For each value of $k$ below, state the most efficient sorting algorithm and give a tight asymptotic runtime bound.

\begin{parts}
\part $k \in O(\log N)$
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Insertion sort is the most efficient in this case because its runtime is $O(N + k)$. The overall runtime bound for insertion sort in this scenario is $O(N)$.
\end{solution}

\part $k \in O(N)$
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Insertion sort for the same reason above. The overall runtime bound for insertion sort in this scenario is $O(N)$.
\end{solution}

\part $k \in O(N^2)$
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Merge sort, quicksort, or heap sort would be ideal here since the number of inversions causes insertion sort to run in $O(N^2)$ runtime. Using one of the three sorts listed earlier yields a runtime in $O(N \log N)$ in the normal case.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}
