\question Why does Least-Significant Digit radix sort work?

\begin{solution}[1in]
The key is to maintain stability during sorting. If we make sure that at each
step we sort stably, then the following proof explains why LSD sort works.

Consider the final step of the algorithm, where we are sorting the first digit.

If two strings differ on the first character, then their ordering will now be
fixed, and since the previous steps of the algorithm relatively sorted the rest
of the string, the ordering will be fully correct.

If two strings do not differ on the first character, e.g., we having $CAT$ and
$CBX$, we know that $CAT$ would appear before $CBX$ because of the previous
steps. All we have to ensure is that this final step doesn't change the
ordering of $CAX$ and $CBX$. This will be ensured, since we make sure we sort
stably.
