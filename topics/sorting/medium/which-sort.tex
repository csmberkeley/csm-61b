  \question Web developers use many different sorts for the different types of lists that they might want to sort. For each of these, provide the best sorting algorithm amongst the following: Mergesort, Quicksort (with Hoare Partitioning), Insertion Sort, LSD Sort. Also, state the worst-case runtime.

\begin{parts}
  \part A list of $N$ packets received by a server over time. Each packet has the timestamp at which the sender sent it. However, some packets may be dropped or arrive out-of-order due to the faulty network. Sort this list by that timestamp (sent time).
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
  Since we expect the list to be largely sorted by time already, with a few packets out of place, we should use insertion sort. Worst case runtime is $O(N^2)$.
\end{solution}
  \part A list of $N$ websites. Each website has the number of total visitors. Sort this list by visitor count.
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
  Quicksort, since it's generally pretty fast for sorting what is effectively a random list of numbers. Worst case runtime is $O(N^2)$.
  Could also argue for LSD sort since there might be some limit $k$ on the total number of visitors, but less preferable.
\end{solution}
  \part After sorting by visitor count, we now want to sort by webpage file size. If websites have the same file size, they should be ordered by visitor count.
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
  Mergesort, since we want to sort stably. Worst case runtime is $O(N\log{N})$.
\end{solution}
  \part A list of 20 names. Sort in alphabetical order.
\begin{solution}[0.75in]
  Insertion sort, since it has the least overhead and is fastest for small lists. Worst case runtime is $O(1)$, since 20 is a constant, and we assume that all names are shorter than some fixed constant as well.
%\end{solution}
%  \part A list of $N$ user ages, where user age is at most $120$.
%\begin{solution}[0.75in]
%  LSD Sort, since we have a fixed alphabet and radix. Worst case runtime is $O(N)$, since the max width is just $3$.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}
