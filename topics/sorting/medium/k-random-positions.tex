\question Given a list of objects that is totally sorted except for
$K < \log N$ randomly chosen elements that are out of place, choose the best
sorting algorithm to solve the problem and give a tight asymptotic runtime
bound.

\begin{solution}[1in]
Use insertion sort. Since each element is at most $N$ spaces away from its
final position, we will need to spend $O(N)$ time moving the item.  The overall
runtime is in $O(N + NK) \in O(NK)$.
\end{solution}
