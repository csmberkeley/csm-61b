\question Time passes and your restaurant is doing well. Unfortunately, our
robot overlords have advanced medicine to the point where humans have become
immortal.

\begin{parts}
\part How could we extend the above algorithm to accept a list of arbitrary
ages?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Radix sort. Sort the customers using the above algorithm, looking at only the
last digit of their age. We would need 10 buckets, since the digit can only
have 10 values. Repeat with the second to last digit, and so on, until the
first digit sorted.
\end{solution}

\part When would we be able to use this type of sort?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
The keys we want to sort must have some \define{base} (or radix). The type of
item must be some combination of symbols.
