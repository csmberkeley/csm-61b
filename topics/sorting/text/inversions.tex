We have a list of $N$ elements that should be sorted, but to our surprise we
recently discovered that there are at most $k$ pairs out of order, or $k$
\textbf{inversions}, in the list. As a small example, the list
\lstinline${ 0, 1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3 }$ contains 5 inversions:
$(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)$.
