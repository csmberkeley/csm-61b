\question Performing Radix Sort seems to be a fast sorting algorithm. Why don't we always use it?

\begin{solution}
Radix sort is only possible when the elements being compared have some radix or base. For strings, 
they can be broken up into individual characters and separately compared, as we did above. We can
also do the same for integers. However, what if we wanted to compare 10 \lstinline$Cat$ objects? 
We cannot compare \lstinline$Cat$ objects by breaking them up into any smaller pieces or radices.
\end{solution}
