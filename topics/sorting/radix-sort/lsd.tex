\question Why does Least-Significant digit sort work?

\begin{solution}
The key thing to maintain in LSD sort is stability. If we make sure that at each step we sort stably, 
then the following proof explains why LSD sort works.

Consider the final step of the algorithm, where we are sorting the first digit. 

If two strings differ on the first character, then their ordering will now be fixed, and since the previous steps of the algorithm relatively sorted the rest of the string, the ordering will be fully correct.

If two strings do not differ on the first character, e.g., we having $CAT$ and $CBX$, we know that $CAT$ would appear $CBX$ because of the previous steps. All we have to ensure is that this final step doesn't change the ordering of $CAX$ and $CBX$. This will be ensured, since we make sure we sort stably.
