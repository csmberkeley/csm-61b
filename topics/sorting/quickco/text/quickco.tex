Malicious Mallory has been hired by a competitor to break into QuickCo, the
world leader in sorting algorithms, and tamper with its Quicksort algorithms by
making them as slow as possible. Mallory succeeded in unlocking the mainframe,
but now she needs your help in slowing QuickCo's algorithms down to a halt!

For this question, assume that the Quicksort algorithm used has three steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Iterate through the array, to count how many elements are smaller than
the pivot, larger than the pivot, and equal to the pivot.
\item Create 3 arrays for smaller, larger and equal elements of the correct
size and then, in a second run through the array, place the appropriate
elements in these arrays.
\item Finally, recurse on the smaller and larger arrays.
\end{enumerate}
