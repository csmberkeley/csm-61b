Malicious Mallory, a sinister hacker, has been hired by a competitor to break
into QuickCo, the world leader in sorting algorithms, and tamper with its
famous Quicksort algorithms by making them as slow as possible. Mallory
succeeded in unlocking the mainframe, but now she needs your help in slowing
QuickCo's algorithms down to a halt!

For this question, assume that the quicksort algorithm used involves three steps. 
First, iterating through the array, to count how many elements are smaller than 
the pivot, larger than the pivot, and equal to the pivot. Second, creating 3 arrays 
for smaller, larger and equal elements of the correct size, and then in a second
run through the array, placing the appropriate elements in these arrays. Finally,
recurse on the smaller and larger arrays.

\begin{lstlisting}
int[] data = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
\end{lstlisting}
