\question First, Mallory decides to change the way QuickCo chooses a pivot for
Quicksort.

Given the \lstinline$int[] data$ of size \lstinline$n$, what choice of pivot would 
cause the worst-case runtime for Quicksort? Expand out the first few steps
of the quicksort algorithms in such a case.

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
First, last, or alternating first-last. The Quicksort algorithm will continue 
in the following fashion:

\begin{verbatim}
{ 1 }, { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }
{ 1 }, { 2 }, { 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }
{ 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }
\end{verbatim}
\ldots

Since the size of our problem is decreasing only by one at each step, this 
will end up doing $O(n)$ work in the first step, $O(n-1)$ in the second step, 
$O(n-3)$ in the next, and so on. This will take $O(n^2)$ work.

\end{solution}
