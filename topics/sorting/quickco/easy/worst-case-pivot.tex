\question Mallory decides to change the way QuickCo chooses a pivot for
Quicksort.

Given the \lstinline$int[] data$ of size \lstinline$n$, what choice of pivot
would cause the worst-case runtime for Quicksort? Expand out the first few
steps of the quicksort algorithms in such a case.

\begin{solution}[1in]
First, last, or alternating first-last. The Quicksort algorithm will continue
in the following fashion:

\begin{verbatim}
{ 1 }, { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }
{ 1 }, { 2 }, { 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }
{ 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }
\end{verbatim}
\ldots

Since the size of our problem is decreasing only by one at each step, this will
end up doing $O(N)$ work in the first step, $O(N-1)$ in the second step,
$O(N-3)$ in the next, and so on. This will take $O(N^2)$ work.
\end{solution}
