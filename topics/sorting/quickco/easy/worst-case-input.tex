\question Mallory finds an algorithm which always selects the middle element
but she is unable to gain write access to it. If the array has an even number
of elements, the algorithm picks the element to the left. However, Mallory discovers
a way to intercept the incoming data and rearrange it before the algorithm runs.

Given the \lstinline$int[] data$ of size \lstinline$n$, rearrange the numbers such 
that the algorithm will run in its worst-case time. Expand out the first few steps
of the quicksort algorithms in such a case.

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{verbatim}
{ 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
\end{verbatim}

In this case, the Quicksort algorithm will proceed as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
Smaller: { 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; Equal: { 9 }
{ 1 }, { 6, 7, 8, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, { 9 }
{ 1 }, { 2 }, { 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 5 }, { 9 }
\end{verbatim}
\ldots

With a similar reasoning as the previous case, this will also take 
$O(n^2)$ work.

\end{solution}
