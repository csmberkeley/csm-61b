\question Mallory finds an algorithm which always selects the middle element
but she is unable to gain write access to it. If the array has an even number
of elements, the algorithm picks the element to the left. However, Mallory
discovers a way to intercept the incoming data and rearrange it before the
algorithm runs.

Given the \lstinline$int[] data$ of size \lstinline$n$, rearrange the numbers
such that the algorithm will run in its worst-case time. Expand out the first
few steps of the quicksort algorithms in such a case.

\begin{solution}[1in]
There are multiple solutions to this problem.
\begin{verbatim}
Case 1: { 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }
The pivot starts as the smallest element and increases: 1, 2, 3, ...

Case 2: { 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 }
The pivot starts as the largest element and decreases: 9, 8, 7, ...

Case 3: { 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
The pivot alternates between the smallest and largest element: 1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7... 
\end{verbatim}

In the third case, for example, the Quicksort algorithm will proceed as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
Pivot: { 1 }; Greater: { 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; 
{ 1 }, { 6, 7, 8, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, { 9 }
{ 1 }, { 2 }, { 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 5 }, { 9 }
\end{verbatim}
\ldots

With a similar reasoning as the worst case pivot choice runtime, this will also take $O(N^2)$
work.
