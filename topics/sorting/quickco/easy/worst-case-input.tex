\question Mallory finds an algorithm which always selects the middle element
but she is unable to gain write access to it. However, she discovers a way to
intercept the incoming data and rearrange it before the algorithm runs.

Given the \lstinline$int[] data$, rearrange the numbers such that the algorithm
will run in its worst-case time.
