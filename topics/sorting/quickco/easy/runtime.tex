\question Does the worst-case runtime of Quicksort depend on the array order, pivot choice, or both? Why?

\begin{solution}[1in]
The worst-case runtime of Quicksort depends on both the array order and the choice of pivots. The worst-case always occurs when the pivot's final position is on an end of the array, which means it was either the smallest or the largest element.
