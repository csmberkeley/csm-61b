In Java, an \define{iterator} is an object which allows us to traverse a data
structure in linear fashion. Every iterator has two methods:
\lstinline$hasNext$ and \lstinline$next$.

\begin{lstlisting}
interface IntIterator {
    boolean hasNext();
    int next();
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
\textbf{Meta:} In general, for all parts of this question, give students time
to work on the problem as well as prompting them to think about what they
\textbf{need} in order to start them off. (For example, what do you need to do
to implement the Iterator Interface? What do you need to know for
\lstinline$hasNext$ to work?)
\end{solution}
