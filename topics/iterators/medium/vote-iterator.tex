\question Define \texttt{VoteIterator}, an iterator that takes in an \texttt{int[] array} of vote counts and iterates over the votes. The input array contains the number of votes each candidate received.

\begin{lstlisting}
int[] array = { 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0 };
\end{lstlisting}

Each candidate, represented by their index, \texttt{i}, should be returned from each call to \texttt{next()} \texttt{array[i]} times in total. Given the input above, calls to \texttt{next()} would eventually return \texttt{1} \textit{twice}, \texttt{2} \textit{once}, and \texttt{4} \textit{once}.

\begin{solution}[3in]
\begin{lstlisting}
public class VoteIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {
    private int[] votes;
    private int index, current;
    public VoteIterator(int[] votes) {
        this.votes = votes;
        this.index = this.current = 0;
    }
    public boolean hasNext() {
        if (current < votes[index]) {
            return true;
        }
        for (int i = index + 1; i < votes.length; i++) {
            if (votes[i] > 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    public Integer next() {
        while (current == votes[index]) {
            index += 1;
            current = 0;
        }
        current += 1;
        return index;
    }
    public void remove() {
        votes[index] -= 1;
        current -= 1;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{Meta:} Lots of students are stuck at understanding what the question
wants them to implement. Highly recommended to go through an example (like
the one provided in the array) to let them understand what the solution should
return at each step.
